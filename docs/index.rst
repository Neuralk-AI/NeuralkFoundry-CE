Introduction
============

**Neuralk Foundry** is a lightweight yet powerful framework for building modular machine learning pipelines â€” particularly well-suited for industrial tasks and representation learning. Whether you're prototyping or scaling up, Foundry helps you build, combine, and orchestrate steps cleanly and efficiently.

Foundry is also the engine behind [**TabBench**](https://github.com/Neuralk-AI/TabBench), Neuralk's internal benchmark for evaluating ML models on real-world tabular datasets.
